Dietary antioxidants are an important preservative in food and have been suggested to help in disease prevention. With consumer demands for less synthetic and safer additives in food products, the food industry is searching for antioxidants that can be marketed as natural. Peptides derived from natural proteins show promise, as they are generally regarded as safe and might additionally contain other bioactivities. Antioxidative peptides are usually obtained from hydrolysates, derived from proteins hydrolysed by a selection of proteases. This trial and error approach to identify antioxidative peptides is slow and cumbersome, increasing interest in developing a computational approach to predict antioxidant peptides and thereby reduce laboratory work. A few previous predictors exist, but no tool predicting the antioxidative properties of peptides is, to the best of our knowledge, currently available as a web-server.
We here present the AnOxPePred tool and web-server (http://services.bioinformatics.dtu.dk/service.php?AnOxPePred-1.0) that uses deep learning to predict a peptide’s antioxidant properties. For training, a curated dataset was constructed consisting of experimentally-tested antioxidants and non-antioxidants. From a variety of metrics, our method displays a prediction performance significantly better than a k-NN sequence identity-based approach. Furthermore, the developed tool will be a good benchmark for future predictors of antioxidant peptides.
